# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- This project showcases React learning. Here, I have just used static UI and made a component to list out the todo list.

## React Components

- components added in the  src/components directory.
- The component below I have created
1. AddTodo --> It has a UI input for date and text.
2. AppName --> Showcase dynamic Todo header
3. TodoItem --> It holds the list of todo items I have. In this component, the item is passed dynamically.

## UI
